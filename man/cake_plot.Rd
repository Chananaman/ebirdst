\title{Cake plot the PIs and PDs in a combined fasion to see directionality with
importance for habitat association and avoidance}
\usage{
cake_plot(path, pis, pds, st_extent, by_cover_class = TRUE,
  pland_and_lpi_only = TRUE, return_data = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{character; Full path to single species STEM results.}

\item{pis}{data.frame; From \code{load_pis()}.}

\item{pds}{data.frame; From \code{load_pds()}.}

\item{st_extent}{list; st_extent list for spatiotemporal filtering. Required,
as results are less meaningful over large spatiotemporal extents.}

\item{by_cover_class}{logical; Default is TRUE. If TRUE, aggregate Fragstats
for the land cover classes into single values for the land cover classes.}

\item{pland_and_lpi_only}{logical; Default is TRUE. If TRUE, only the percent
of land cover (PLAND) and largest patch index (LPI) fragstats are used.}

\item{return_data}{logical; Default is FALSE. If TRUE, returns the data
that went into the cake plot for further manipulation.}
}
\value{
Plots a cake plot, or if return_data = TRUE, the data from the cake
plot as well.
}
\description{
A cake plot is a stacked area chart, showing both the relative importance of
the land cover classes, as well as the directionality of the land cover
classes, by showing the stacked areas above and below a 0 line. This is one
of, if not the most, computationally expensive operations in the package.
